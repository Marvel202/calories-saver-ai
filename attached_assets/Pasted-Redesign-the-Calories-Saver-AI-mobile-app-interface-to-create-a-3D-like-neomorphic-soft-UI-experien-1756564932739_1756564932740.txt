Redesign the Calories Saver AI mobile app interface to create a 3D-like, neomorphic/soft UI experience, where every element feels tactile and interactive. The goal is to make the interface feel like a physical, touchable space rather than a flat 2D layout. Use the following guidelines to achieve this effect:


Layout and Depth:

Structure the interface with layered, overlapping elements to create a sense of depth and dimensionality.
Use subtle elevation and shadows to make buttons, cards, and interactive elements appear as if they are floating slightly above the surface.
Arrange the upload/capture section, results card, and CTAs in a way that mimics real-world objects, with natural spacing and perspective.



Neomorphic/Soft UI Style:

Apply soft, diffused shadows to all interactive elements (buttons, cards, input fields) to give them a 3D, pressed, or raised appearance.
Use gradient shading on buttons and cards to simulate light falling on a 3D object, enhancing the tactile feel.
Ensure rounded corners on all elements, but add subtle highlights and lowlights to reinforce the 3D effect.
Incorporate a frosted glass or translucent effect for background elements to create a sense of depth and layering.



Color Scheme:

Stick to a soft, muted color palette with light backgrounds (whites, light grays) and subtle color accents (e.g., light pinks, blues, or greens) to maintain a clean, modern, and inviting look.
Use high-contrast colors sparingly for key actions (e.g., upload button, results display) to draw attention while keeping the 3D effect intact.



Interactive Elements:

Design the upload/capture button to look like a physical button—slightly raised when inactive and appearing to "press down" when tapped.
Style the meal upload/capture card as a 3D container with a soft shadow and a slight inner glow to make it feel like a tangible object.
Add a subtle animation when the user interacts with buttons or cards (e.g., a gentle "push" effect when pressed).



Visual Hierarchy and Realism:

Use light and shadow to create the illusion of depth, making elements like cards and buttons appear as if they could be picked up or manipulated.
Ensure the camera icon or placeholder image in the upload section has a slightly raised or inset appearance, reinforcing the 3D feel.
Display the macronutrient results in a floating card that casts a soft shadow on the background, as if it’s hovering above the surface.



Typography and Imagery:

Use clean, modern typography with subtle text shadows or embossing to make the text feel like it’s part of the 3D environment.
Incorporate high-quality meal images that appear to sit within the interface, rather than on top of it. For example, the meal photo could have a slight drop shadow to make it feel embedded in the card.



Micro-Interactions:

Add smooth, realistic animations for interactions, such as buttons that depress slightly when tapped or cards that lift when selected.
Include a loading animation that mimics a real-world object (e.g., a spinning 3D circle or a progress bar that fills like a liquid).



Results Display:

Present the macronutrient breakdown in a 3D card that appears to pop out from the interface, with subtle gradients and shadows to enhance the dimensional effect.
Highlight nutrient values with bold, slightly raised text or inset numbers to make them feel like physical labels.



Overall Feel:

The interface should feel responsive and dynamic, with every interaction reinforcing the 3D experience.
Avoid flat colors or sharp edges—every element should have depth, texture, or a tactile quality to create an immersive experience.
